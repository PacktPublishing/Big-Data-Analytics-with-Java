# Big-Data-Analytics-with-Java

This is the readme for the book "Big Data Analytics with Java".

Before running the samples you need to follow the following steps.

## We use Intellij, but any IDE like eclipse can be used.

## We use maven so maven should be preinstalled or you can use the Maven bundled with your IDE itself.

## We use Java 8 for our samples. But java 9 can also be used.

## There is a main project called as "bdaj" in this repository. This project has the entire code of 10 chapters.

## The remaining four chapters that is chp3, chp 12 and chp 13 have their own individual projects in this repository and can be separately built in the IDE and used

## Note : The charts used in data exploration in all the chapters are part of the code of chp 3 project only in this repository.

## Within the java package of each chapter we have its respective "readme.md" file
